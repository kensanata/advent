# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is "a series of small
programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels." I'm going to try
to solve these puzzles in various programming languages.

The code I wrote and the wording of the questions is dedicated to
the [public domain](LICENSE). The actual wording of the original
questions and the entertaining backstory that ties them all together
is of course copyright [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
