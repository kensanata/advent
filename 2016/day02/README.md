# Day 2: Emacs Lisp

## Part 1

You start on key 5 on a keypad as shown below. With instructions to go
up, down, left or right. Ignore instructions that would take you off
the keypad.

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

The example input provided for the four numbers is shown below. At the
end of each line youâ€™ll end up on the key which is part of the answer.
In this example the correct answer is `1985`.

```
