# Day 9: Javascript

## Part 1

Process a string containing instructions such as (AxB) where A and B
are integers saying to repeat the next A characters B times. What's
the length of the expanded string? The expansions are not processed.
Examples given:

```
ADVENT → 6
A(1x5)BC → ABBBBBC → 7
(6x1)(1x3)A → (1x3)A → 6
```

## Part 2

Same thing, but now expansions *are* processed.

```
X(8x2)(3x3)ABCY → XABCABCABCABCABCABCY → 20
```
