# Day 1

## First Part

Given a list of strings, count the number of strings that contain
exactly two of any letter, count the number of strings that contain
exactly three of any letter, and multiply the two numbers.

Example:

```
    String Doubles Triples
    abcdef    0       0
    bababc    1       1
    abbcde    1       0
    abcccd    0       1
    aabcdd    1       0
    abcdee    1       0
    ababab    0       1
	------ ------ --------
	Sums      4       3
	
	Result: 4 Ã— 3 = 12
```
