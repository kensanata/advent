# Day 5
## Part 1

Your input is a string containing upper and lower case letters. Keep
removing pairs of letters where the same letters is once lower case
and once upper case.

Example:
```
dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.
dabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
dabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).
dabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.
```

How long is the remaining string?
