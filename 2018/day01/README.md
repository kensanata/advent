# Day 1

## First Part

You must add numbers to 0. Example input: +1, -2, +3, +1. The expected
result would be 3.

## Second Part

Keep doing that, reapplying the input until you get a repeat of a
result. Given the example input, the results would be +1, -1, +2, +3,
(start loop and continue) +4, +2. So the first repeat is +2.
