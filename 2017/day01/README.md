# Day 1: Forth

## First Part

The puzzle input is a sequence of digits. Find the sum of all digits
that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the
digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.

For example: 1122 produces a sum of 3 (1 + 2) because the first digit
(1) matches the second digit and the third digit (2) matches the
fourth digit.
